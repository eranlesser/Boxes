i've included a refernce video in the folder. F17_1024x768.wmv

in this scene, all that happans is the boat saling from side to side in a slight sinus wave.
the scene animation is in 25fps.

movment of the boat starts from x534 y195. it takes the boat 10sec to get from one side to the other.
here are the info for the time and placments from right side to the left:

timing(sec)	x		y

0			534		195
2			398		200
4			262		195
6			126		200
8			-10		195		
10			-143	200

the movment to the other side is on the same concept just reveresed, and with the boat flipped on the x axis.
