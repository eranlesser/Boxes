scene runs 25 fps


this is the most complicated scene in the whole app!!!

there are 2 hirarcies in this scene.
1. the elevator and the glow of the button.
2. the windows BG and all of the rest of the elements thats attached to it.

when i write the elevator is moving it says the the "button glow" is also moving with it. same goes for the windows BG - when it moves all of the other stuff move with it.

scene starts with all of the elements in their initial position.
the button glow is blinking, a loop of the following until it is pressed: 
15 frames 100% opacity, 5 frames transition to 0% opcity, 30 frames 0% opacity, 5 frames transition to 100% opacity.
once pressed the button glow stays 100% opacity.

after the button glow is pressed the elevator starts to move up until y-670 for 20sec in a linear speed.
every 2 sec a different light in the pannel lights up (to indicate to floors rising), using the same "button glow asset.
according to the following order (im indicating the first x,y in relation to the scene, and afterward its the delta from that position)
1. x319 y509
2. x342 y508
3. x356 y506
4. x318 y485
5. x340 y485
6. x362 y484
7. x317 y465
8. x339 y463
9. x361 y462

and now for the twist...

once the elevator reaches the point of y-260 the whole scene starts to move to the left, which means:
the elevator and all attached to it moves to x-482 (ease in the start and ease out in the end) for 10sec.
the windows BG and all attached to it moves to x-2 (ease in the start and ease out in the end) for 10sec.

now the scene screen is filled with all of the windows.

each hotspot click opens the relevant window. the frame switches from closed state to open.
after a window is open, it stays that way, no way to close it again.

once a window is open an addition interaction is possible by clicking the same hotspot.

upper left:
clicking the window will cause the "F11_1024x768_light_x952_y76.jpg" layer to turn from 100% opacity to 0% in 0.5sec.
clicking again will cause the oposit interaction (close the light)

upper right:
clicking the window will cause the "F11_1024x768_paper_drop_x1590_y48.jpg" layer to turn from 0% opacity to 100% instantly.
once activated the state stayes the same (no reapeated interaction).

lower left:
once touching the window, sound FX will be played.
will be reapeted with every click.

lwer right:
touching the window will cause a smoke (particles) rise from the coffe cups.
you can use the "F11_1024x768_smoke_particle.png".
touching the window creates a flow of smoke with these specs (i guess we will adjust once it will work):
- origin place is x761 y557 (after the scene is on the windows BG frame)
- 25 per sec. (10% random) (for 2sec)
- moves 50px on y axis up for 1sec. (10% random)
- starts in 100% opacity and turns 0% at the max hight. 
- 10% random on x axis for +-10px.

particle seq reapeted with every click on window.

thats it i hope.
