scene at 25 fps

constant animation in the background are the clouds in the sky - they move 150px to the right side every sec.
the clouds images should run in an endless loop - same as the bus backgrounds in scene 10.

before ballon being pressed he moves slightly in the place on y axis - start position and -10px on y axis.

the ballon,fire,firebucket move a one group.

the idea of this scene is that every time the user presses the ballon a flame is lit for 1 sec,
if the user keeps on pressing the ballon the flames keeps on, un til he leaves (if more than 1 sec.
there are 3 images for the fire to run in loop all the time while pressed (no delay between them.
every time the fire is lit (user presses) the ballon rises a bit in aqn angle of about 60-70 degrees.
easeing in and out on begining and stop of movement (after 1sec press move). ballon moves about 50px each sec.
max movement is until the ballon is out of the scene.
