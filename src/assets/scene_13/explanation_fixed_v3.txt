scene starts with man in the state of a manwalk. once the man in pressed, the man changes to the state of man walk.
the background always has a white noise of people speaking. once the man is pressed,
the noise gradually gets silent (0.5 sec), and than the man says his line while no noise around.
after the man finishes to talk (delay of 1 sec) the noise gradually starts again (0.5 sec).
man stays on the bucket afterward all the time. pressing him starts the process again (of him speaking).


*** fixes: ***
--------------

1. only thing is the sound issue.
	it shouldnt break so hard - need to gradually stop for 0.5sec, and when back up also 0.5sec to full sound.

	
*** text box movement *** (in general)

added text layers + box.
the text layer is linked to the box and moves with it.
once narration is finished the text box moves out of the screen. 0.5sec
if the user presses the small tabs tha appears in the upper left of the screen the text box moves to its position.
once the upper left corner of the text box is touched the box moves out of the screen. (hotspot)

scene 10 has a video demonstrating the text box movement.


*** fixes: v3 ***
