scene at 25 fps

constant animation in the background cloud2 - move 150px to the right side every sec until out of screen.
constant animation in the background cloud1 - move 130px to the right side every sec until out of screen.
the clouds images should run in an endless loop - same as scene 27.

ballon is moving to the right of the scene from it initial position automatically up to position x1035 y-81 - duration 15sec.
no repeat for the ballon - once out of scene - it stays out.

the birds in this scene are added by pressing the screen (wherever pressed, there will the bord appear).
long press will produce still only i bird.
randomization:
basic movement of the bird is 300px on x axis per sec.
randomization between the 2 birds for appearance.
randomization for the direction the bird appears (which will decide what direction it will fly in).
randomization for the size (and speed) of the bird 100%-75% (which will reduce speed accordingly, also smaller birds are more backward on layers and vise versa).
