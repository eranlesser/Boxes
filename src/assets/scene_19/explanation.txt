i've included a video for refernce. (F19_sea.wmv)

scene runs at 25fps

the scene has a loop of automatic animation that playes all the time - never ending - of the sea.
sea goes up and down into the scene. easing in when its at the highest point, and easing out when moving out.
also the drops below the sea go from 100% visible when the sea at the highest point, stays in that state for 0.5sec and disappears to 0% after 2sec.
sea goes up for 2 sec, and goes down for 2 sec.
starting position is the hogest point and y800 is the lowest point.

1st state of the man is "F19_1024x768_man_reg_x369_y237.png",, once touching him or the cat (F19_1024x768_man_hotspot_x383_y255.png),
makes the images switch to "F19_1024x768_man_after_x363_y237.png" (the 1st immage disappears).
