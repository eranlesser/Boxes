the bus_bg layer is a repeatin pattern on the x axis (seamless) - it should run endlessly to the right (moving forward).
the inside layer should have slight jumps (up to 10px up or down) to mimik a moving bus (not too mechanic movement).
once the screen is touched - bus jumps stop and background movment also (takes about half a sec)
stays on hold for 3 sec, and then starts to run again (takes about half a sec)
