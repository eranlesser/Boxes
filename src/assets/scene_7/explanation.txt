scene at 25 fps


scene loads with only the background.

Touching the left upper frame will turn the water on and a red bank appear near his belly.
the water is buily from 3 images that run in sequebce - each image runs for 0.1 sec. when thouched again the reg star disappears and the water stops.

Touching the middle upper frame will make him say "ouch" and the red star will emerge around his belly.

Touching the left bottom frame will make the red star appear by the man's shoulder,
as he exclaims in pain (sound effect).
the shower is then activated - also built with 3 images, just like the water above.
a set of 15 random images are starting to load slowly from the bath in the are around (x80 up to x490) and startin at y627.
the bubbles ride slowly in a rate of 3 sec (+20% randomization), and once they reach the hight of y369 they disappear. about 5-7 bubbles per sec as the emitter.
once the user taps again, bang disappears, shower stops, and bubbles stop too, but the ones that were created still complete thier climb.

Touching the bottom right frame will make him gasp (sound effect - we will need to sync once we will have the sound). 
His mouth opens to a little circle and closes again.
