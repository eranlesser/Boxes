ballon animation:

ballon is moving to the right of the scene from it initial position automatically up to position x1033 y220. 
the ballon is also reduced to 50% with an ease out. duration of movement 15sec.
after 12 sec of movement, there is an additional movement that will come from behind the city layer and from bottom to top.
this layer will we be the credits titles. at the end of this layer there will be a text box with the writing like "this book belogs to...",
and an option for the kid to input his name there. this text box will stop on screen and stays there while the credits will disappear on the top.

no repeat for the ballon - once out of scene - it stays out.
