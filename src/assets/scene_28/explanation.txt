constant animation in the background are the clouds in the sky - they move 150px to the right side every sec until out of screen.
the clouds images should run in an endless loop - same as scene 27.

only animation in this scene.

ballon is moving to the right of the scene from it initial position automatically up to position x1067 y2 - duration 15sec.
no repeat for the ballon - once out of scene - it stays out.
