the idea is that the user can drag man through the scene while the cat follows him.
each character is built from 2 parts - and the back part of them (man bottom / tail) is slightly in delay and rotates.
character rotates acording to moving vector (toward the direction of movement).
after left the charactrs move a little more in the last direction, until they stop.


there are 3 hirarchy in this scene. 
man top - man bottom
cat bodt - tail
man - cat

cat always follows the man (in slight delay)

 
back part rotation info:

man:
man bottom rotation axis x135 y70 (relatively to its own size)
angle rotation +-5 degrees

cat:
cat tail rotation axis x92 y17 (relatively to its own size)
angle rotation +-5 degrees
