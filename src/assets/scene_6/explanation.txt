scene at 12 fps


scene loads with only the background.
once touching the man - the "man_above" layer is loaded on top of the background image. 
the "man_above" layer is visible only as long as the finger is pressed on the tablet - once release it disappears.
after the man was pressed (regardless if holding finger or not) a delay of 0.5 sec and the cat peeps (sequence).
the cat stays at the final state for 2sec and then the reverse animation (backward).
once the cat procedure had started it cant be activated again until the whole procedure is finished (appearing - disappearing).
touching the man again while the cat is peeping wont reset the animation from the begining. only after it is finished - we can make the cat pop again.
