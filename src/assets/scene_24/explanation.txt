this is a dramatic point in the story.
the ball is supposed to rise from behind the sea and then stop at a certain point.
this rise is supposed to be escorted with a dramatic sound/music. 
the user cant do nothing until the ballon has stopped.
once he stopped - the user can touch the ballon - what will trigger the scene to progress to the next one automatically.

scene speed: 25fps

ballon start: x184 y523
ballon end: x184 y363
duration: 10 sec

there should be a ease toward the end of the movement (the last 1sec)
