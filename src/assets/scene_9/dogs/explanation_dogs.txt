order of layers: (from back to front)

all the scene acts as it already did. these layers are only the addition.
each dog/pig has its own hotspot.
constant usuall state is number 1. once touched the animations are:
	pig: changes to state 2 for 1 sec, and then returns to state 1.
	mldog: changes in a loop of animation between states 2+3 for 1.5 sec, performing about 7-8 loops. and then returns to state 1.
	smldog: changes in a loop of animation between states 2+3+4 for 1.5 sec, performing about 6-7 loops. and then returns to state 1.
	
	i also agree with what you said regarding the bus headlights, we need to add the blue indicator there too.
