The Text Layer


i've included a refernce image in the folder. F9_reference.JPG

scene starts with the background positioned at x-512 y0.
the user can press the headlights of the bus and then the buslights layer is turned on/off.
another thing the user can do is press the plates of the bus and then he gets a keyboard where he can write his name.
there should be a save state for this name, so that when the user will reopen the app after closing it will still be there.
in its initial state the plate should say "Press Me".

the text layer:
the font that we will use will be tahoma, bold, size 22.
the user will have 9 characters to enter.
text box placement is x619 y341.
the rotation angle is 3.5 ccw.

after the user presses the continue to next scene, the scene moves to the right (creating a pan left effect) - duration (1.5 sec with ease in and out).
depending on the state of the bus light they may be on/off.
once reaching to the left of the image the user can drag the scene to the left/right by pressing + holding + moving to the desired side.
clicking the next scene button now will make the story go to the next frame.
